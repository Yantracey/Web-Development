# Web-Development


### HTTP Requests and Responses
In this section, I accurately identified the type of architecture for the HTTP request and response process, listed the components of an HTTP request, and outlined the three parts of an HTTP response. Additionally, I demonstrated a solid understanding of HTTP status codes and common request methods, particularly those encountered by security professionals.

### Using curl
I successfully highlighted the advantages of employing curl over a browser and correctly identified relevant curl options for changing the request method, setting headers, and viewing response headers. Additionally, I addressed potential attacker actions involving HTTP requests, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of curl functionalities.

### Sessions and Cookies
In the section dedicated to Sessions and Cookies, I provided accurate responses regarding the response header that sends a cookie to the client, the request header for continuing a client's session, and demonstrated knowledge of using cookies with curl for managing and swapping sessions.

### Example HTTP Requests and Responses
This part involved the meticulous analysis of a sample HTTP request and response. I correctly identified the request method, expressed the client's preference for an encrypted response, and determined the presence of a user session. I also made informed inferences about the likely content in the response body.

### Monoliths and Microservices
I accurately identified the individual components of microservices, described a service that writes to a database and communicates with other services, and recognized the underlying technology enabling microservices to be scalable and redundant.

### Deploying and Testing a Container Set
In this section, I correctly identified the tool for deploying multiple containers, the required file format for deploying a container set, and provided relevant information about databases, including SQL queries.

### Navigating Docker Compose
Successfully navigating through Docker Compose, using curl to log in to WordPress, saving cookies to a cookie jar, testing a WordPress page using a saved cookie, and attempting to access a privileged WordPress admin page for a user named Ryan showcased an application of learned concepts in a practical scenario.


Overall, the completion of the Challenge assignment reflects a comprehensive understanding of various web development concepts and tools. The meticulous responses provided in the accompanying PDF file demonstrate a strong grasp of HTTP, curl, sessions, cookies, microservices, containerization, and database queries.
